Muc5ac,Mucin-5AC,"similar to MUC2, produced by surface goblet cells",Gel-forming glycoprotein of gastric and respiratory tract epithelia
MyD88,Myeloid differentiation primary response 88,"TLR protein, NF-kB IRAK protein, inflammation marker by TLR",canonical adaptor for inflammatory signaling pathways downstream of members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor families
NKp46,Natural Killer cell p46,NK marker,innate lymphocytes that efficiently eliminate cancerous and infected cells
PPIA,Peptidylprolyl isomerase A,HKG,"catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds, which allows it to regulate many biological processes, including intracellular signaling, transcription, inflammation, and apoptosis"
PPIB,Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B,HKG,"catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds, which allows it to regulate protein folding of type I collagen"
Prf1,Perforin-1,"perforin, should be dominant in primary infections, but must be correlated between T-cell and NK cell expresions","Pore-forming protein that plays a key role in secretory granule-dependent cell death, and in defense against virus-infected or neoplastic cells"
Relm-b,Resistin-like molecule-β,mucosal defense factor (goblet cells),cysteine-rich cytokine expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and implicated in insulin resistance and gastrointestinal nematode immunity
